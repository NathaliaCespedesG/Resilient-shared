# Database Backend

This is a simple and readable format, and it doesn't require any external tools or plugins.

### 2. **Using `tree` Command Output (if you want to automate it)**

If you're using a Unix-based operating system (Linux or macOS), you can use the `tree` command to generate a directory structure and copy it to your `README.md` file.

1. First, install the `tree` command if you don't have it:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install tree   # For Debian/Ubuntu
    brew install tree           # For macOS with Homebrew
    ```

2. Then, run the command:
    ```bash
    tree -L 2 > structure.txt   # To display the folder structure up to two levels deep
    ```

3. This will create a `structure.txt` file with the folder structure, which you can copy and paste into your `README.md`.

### 3. **Use a Visual Diagram (Markdown with ASCII)**

For a more visual representation using ASCII characters, you can create a diagram using characters like pipes (`|`) and dashes (`-`). For example:

```markdown
# Folder Structure

root-folder
│
├── src
│   ├── components
│   └── styles
├── public
└── README.md
